# P2P-Application-Network
Run `p2p_server.py` on each computer in your LAN to create a custom P2P Application Network between them.
## Pay attention
This will not work on windows computers because they don't allow broadcasts even if you turn your firewall off. I've tested it on a bunch of raspberry with a common ufw firewall and it worked. If you have a ufw firewall enabled you will have to allow the ports that the program uses to communicate.
